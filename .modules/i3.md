# i3-gaps
[i3](https://i3wm.org) is a popular [window manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_manager).

I use i3 for its [tiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager) aspect and gaps for aesthetics. Some prefer not to use gaps since they technically take up some space: to address this issue I have an "immersive mode" keybinding which minimizes gaps and hides bars.

At the moment I use Polybar as bar (see the [Polybar module](polybar.md)), but many can be used, including i3-bar.



## Tweaks
You may want to change the script `display.sh` to adjust to your monitors' needs.
