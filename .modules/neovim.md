# Neovim
[Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) is a popular fork of the even more popular [Vim](https://www.vim.org) editor for powerusers.

Since Vim and Neovim are very customizable editors, lots of plugins can be used, which can have external dependencies. You can find a description of the plugins I use or know [here](../neovim/.config/nvim/plugin_archive.vim).

All plugins are installed by the vim-plug package manager, which in turn is automatically downloaded if not present.
