# Fish
[Fish](https://fishshell.com) is a POSIX incompatible shell aimed for interactive use.

The list of plugins I use with fish can be found [here](../fish/.config/fish/fish_plugins). The fisher plugin manager automatically installs them once it is automatically installed itself (through a script in my config).



## Integrations
A lot of other modules plug their configuration in the shell's, including aliases, functions and env variables.



## Dependencies
- fish


### Optional
- curl (fisher installation)
- zoxide (fast directory switching)
- direnv (environment per current directory)
- fzf (directory exploring)
And others with specific aliases not worth mentioning.
